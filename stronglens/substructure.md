Lensing flux-ratio anomalies have been frequently observed and taken
as evidence for the presence of abundant dark matter substructures in
lensing galaxies, as predicted by the cold dark matter (CDM) model of
cosmogony. In previous work, we examined the cusp-caustic relations of
the multiple images of background quasars lensed by galaxy-scale dark
matter haloes, using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations
(the Aquarius simulations). In this work, we extend our previous
calculations to incorporate both the baryonic and diffuse dark
components in lensing haloes. We include in each lensing simulation:
(1) a satellite galaxy population derived from a semi-analytic model
applied to the Aquarius haloes; (2) an empirical Milky Way globular
cluster population and (3) satellite streams (diffuse dark component)
identified in the simulations. Accounting for these extra components,
we confirm our earlier conclusion that the abundance of intrinsic
substructures (dark or bright, bound or diffuse) is not sufficient to
explain the observed frequency of cusp-caustic violations in the
Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS). We conclude that the observed
effect could be the result of the small number statistics of CLASS, or
intergalactic haloes along the line of sight acting as additional
sources of lensing flux anomalies. Another possibility is that this
discrepancy signals a failure of the CDM model.

"We conclude that the abundance of intrinsic substructures, dark or bright, bound or diffuse, cannot fully account for the observed cusp-violation frequency. Taken at face value, this lack of substructure suggests a serious problem for the CDM model. Warm dark matter models, which could reduce the satellite abundance and may help to bring the dwarf galaxy LF into agreement with observations without invoking strong feedback or photoionization effects (e.g. Sawala et al. 2010), would only make this problem worse. However, it is possible that the observed frequency of flux anomalies is strongly biased by the small number statistics of CLASS."

<li> Nierenberg, A. 2014, Detecting dark matter substructure with narrow line lensing, HST Proposal, 13732: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014hst..prop13732N

The abundance of low mass halos is one of the key predictions of LCDM
and remains at apparent odds with observations of luminous
structure. Strong gravitational lensing provides a straightforward
means of testing this theory as it enables the detection of dark
matter subhalos at cosmological distances, without requiring the
structure to contain any baryons at all. The fluxes of strongly
lensed, parsec scale sources in particular, are excellent probes as
they are extremely sensitive to the presence of low mass subhalos,
while still being extended enough to remain unaffected by microlensing
by stars which is a dominant contaminant for smaller
sources. Traditionally this field has been limited to the analysis of
the small number of strongly lensed, radio-loud quasars. Quasar
narrow-line emission offers an alternative to radio. It is also parsec
scale and microlensing free, but has the benefit of detectable in a
much larger sample of systems. This proposal will combine
milliarcsecond astrometry, and percent level photometry attainable
with WFC3 IR grism, in order to measure spatially resolved narrow line
lensing in six new systems, which cannot be studied from the
ground. We have demonstrated that data of this quality can be used to
detect subhalos as small as a million solar masses. This proposal will
double the sample of systems which can be used to detect dark, low
mass substructure using flux ratio anomalies.

Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful test of Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) as it enables the detection and mass measurement of low
mass haloes even if they do not contain baryons. Compact lensed
sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are particularly
sensitive to perturbing subhalos, but their use as a test of CDM has
been limited by the small number of systems which have significant
radio emission. Radio emission is extended enough avoid significant
lensing by stars in the plane of the lens galaxy, and red enough to be
minimally affected by differential dust extinction. Narrow-line
emission is a promising alternative as it is also extended and, unlike
radio, detectable in virtually all optically selected AGN lenses. We
present first results from a WFC3 grism narrow-line survey of lensed
quasars, for the quadruply lensed AGN HE0435-1223. Using a forward
modelling pipeline which enables us to robustly account for blending
between nearby images and the main lens galaxy, we measure the [OIII]
5007 \AA flux ratios of the four lensed quasar images. We find that
the lensed [OIII] fluxes and positions are well fit by a simple smooth
mass model for the main lens. Our data rule out a >10^8(10^7.2)M600/M⊙
NFW perturber within ∼1."0 (0."1) arcseconds of the lensed images,
where M600 is the perturber mass within its central 600 pc. The
non-detection is broadly consistent with the expectations of ΛCDM for
a single system. The sensitivity achieved demonstrates that powerful
limits on the nature of dark matter can be obtained with the analysis
of the entire sample of narrow-line lenses.

We present 11.2 μm observations of the gravitationally lensed,
radio-loud zs = 2.64 quasar MG0414+0534, obtained using the Michelle
camera on Gemini North. We find a flux ratio anomaly of A2/A1 = 0.93 ±
0.02 for the quasar images A1 and A2. When combined with the 11.7 μm
measurements from Minezaki et al., the A2/A1 flux ratio is nearly 5σ
from the expected ratio for a model based on the two visible lens
galaxies. The mid-IR flux ratio anomaly can be explained by a
satellite (substructure), 0.''3 northeast of image A2, as can the
detailed very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) structures of the
jet produced by the quasar. When we combine the mid-IR flux ratios
with high-resolution VLBI measurements, we find a best-fit mass
between 106.2 and 107.5 M ⊙ inside the Einstein radius for a satellite
substructure modeled as a singular isothermal sphere at the redshift
of the main lens (zl = 0.96). We are unable to set an interesting
limit on the mass to light ratio due to its proximity to the quasar
image A2. While the observations used here were technically difficult,
surveys of flux anomalies in gravitational lenses with the James Webb
Space Telescope will be simple, fast, and should well constrain the
abundance of substructure in dark matter halos.

We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations of SDSS J1029+2623,
a three-image quasar lens system produced by a foreground cluster at z
= 0.584. Our strong lensing analysis reveals six additional multiply
imaged galaxies in addition to the multiply imaged quasar. We confirm
the complex nature of the mass distribution of the lensing cluster,
with a bimodal dark matter distribution which deviates from the
Chandra X-ray surface brightness distribution. The Einstein radius of
the lensing cluster is estimated to be θE = 15.2 ± 0.5 arcsec for the
quasar redshift of z = 2.197. We derive a radial mass distribution
from the combination of strong lensing, HST/ACS weak lensing and
Subaru/Suprime-cam weak lensing analysis results, finding a
best-fitting virial mass of Mvir = 1.55+ 0.40- 0.35 × 1014 h- 1 M⊙ and
a concentration parameter of cvir = 25.7+ 14.1- 7.5. The lensing mass
estimate at the outer radius is smaller than the X-ray mass estimate
by a factor of ˜2. We ascribe this large mass discrepancy to shock
heating of the intracluster gas during a merger, which is also
suggested by the complex mass and gas distributions and the high value
of the concentration parameter. In the HST image, we also identify a
probable galaxy, GX, in the vicinity of the faintest quasar image
C. In strong lens models, the inclusion of GX explains the anomalous
flux ratios between the quasar images. The morphology of the highly
elongated quasar host galaxy is also well reproduced. The best-fitting
model suggests large total magnifications of 30 for the quasar and 35
for the quasar host galaxy, and has an AB time delay consistent with
the measured value.

Multiply-imaged quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed in
the mid-infrared (MIR) range are commonly assumed to be unaffected by
the microlensing produced by the stars in their lensing galaxy. In
this paper, we investigate the validity domain of this
assumption. Indeed, that premise disregards microlensing of the
accretion disc in the MIR range, and does not account for recent
progress in our knowledge of the dusty torus, which has unveiled
relatively compact dust emission. To simulate microlensing, we first
built a simplified image of the quasar composed of (i) an accretion
disc whose size is based on accretion disc theory, and (ii) a larger
ring-like torus whose radius is guided by interferometric measurements
in nearby AGNs. The mock quasars are created in the 1044.2-1046 erg/s
(unlensed) luminosity range, which is typical of known lensed quasars,
and are then microlensed using an inverse ray-shooting code. We
simulated the wavelength dependence of microlensing for different
lensed image types and for various fractions of compact objects in the
lens. This allows us to derive magnification probabilities as a
function of wavelength, as well as to calculate the
microlensing-induced deformation of the spectral energy distribution
of the lensed images. We find that microlensing variations as large as
0.1 mag are very common at 11 μm (typically rest-frame 4 μm). The main
signal comes from microlensing of the accretion disc, which may be
significant even when the fraction of flux from the disc is as small
as 5% of the total flux. We also show that the torus of sources with
Lbol ≲ 10^{45} erg/s is expected to be noticeably
microlensed. Microlensing may thus be used to get insight into the
rest near-infrared inner structure of AGNs. Finally, we investigate
whether microlensing in the mid-infrared can alter the so-called Rcusp
relation that links the fluxes of the lensed images triplet produced
when the source lies close to a cusp macro-caustic. This relation is
commonly used to identify massive (dark-matter) substructures in
lensing galaxies. We find that significant deviations from Rcusp may
be expected, which means that microlensing can explain part of the
flux ratio problem.

We present results from Chandra observations of the cluster lens SDSS
J1029+2623 at zl = 0.58, which is a gravitationally lensed quasar with
the largest known image separation. We clearly detect X-ray emission
both from the lensing cluster and the three lensed quasar images. The
cluster has an X-ray temperature of kT = 8.1+2.0 - 1.2 keV and
bolometric luminosity of L X = 9.6 × 1044 erg s-1. Its surface
brightness is centered near one of the brightest cluster galaxies, and
it is elongated east-west. We identify a subpeak northwest of the main
peak, which is suggestive of an ongoing merger. Even so, the X-ray
mass inferred from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption appears to
be consistent with the lensing mass from the Einstein radius of the
system. We find significant absorption in the soft X-ray spectrum of
the faintest quasar image, which can be caused by an intervening
material at either the lens or source redshift. The X-ray flux ratios
between the quasar images (after correcting for absorption) are in
reasonable agreement with those at optical and radio wavelengths, and
all the flux ratios are inconsistent with those predicted by simple
mass models. This implies that microlensing effect is not significant
for this system and dark matter substructure is mainly responsible for
the anomalous flux ratios.
