"On the origin of the flux ratio anomaly in quadruple lens systems"
by	Inoue, Kaiki Taro


We explore the origin of the flux ratio anomaly in quadruple lens systems. 
Using a semi-analytic method based on N-body simulations, we estimate the 
effect of a possible magnification perturbation caused by subhaloes with a 
mass scale of <10^9 1/h Msun in lensing galaxy haloes.

This feature also supports that the flux ratio anomaly is caused mainly by 
line-of-sight structures rather than subhaloes. We also discuss a possible 
imprint of line-of-sight structures in the demagnification of minimum images 
due to locally underdense structures in the line of sight.

SHARP - II. Mass structure in strong lenses is not necessarily dark matter substructure: a flux ratio anomaly from an edge-on disc in B1555+375
Hsueh, J.-W. et al.

Gravitational lens flux-ratio anomalies provide a powerful technique for measuring
dark matter substructure in distant galaxies. However, before using these flux-ratio
 anomalies to test galaxy formation models, it is imperative to ascertain that the 
given anomalies are indeed due to the presence of dark matter substructure and not 
due to some other component of the lensing galaxy halo or to propagation effects. 
Here we present the case of CLASS B1555+375, which has a strong radio-wavelength 
flux-ratio anomaly. Our high-resolution near-infrared Keck II adaptive optics 
imaging and archival Hubble Space Telescope data reveal the lensing galaxy in this 
system to have a clear edge-on disc component that crosses directly over the pair 
of images that exhibit the flux-ratio anomaly. We find that simple models that 
include the disc can reproduce the cm-wavelength flux-ratio anomaly without 
requiring additional dark matter substructure. Although further studies are 
required, our results suggest the assumption that all flux-ratio anomalies are due 
to a population of dark matter sub-haloes may be incorrect, and analyses that do 
not account for the full complexity of the lens macro-model may overestimate the 
substructure mass fraction in massive lensing galaxies.

Strong lensing signatures of luminous structure and substructure in early-type 
galaxies
Gilman, Daniel et al.

The arrival times, positions, and fluxes of multiple images in strong lens systems can be 
used to infer the presence of dark subhalos in the deflector, and thus test predictions of 
cold dark matter models. However, gravitational lensing does not distinguish between 
perturbations to a smooth gravitational potential arising from baryonic and non-baryonic 
mass. In this work, we quantify the extent to which the stellar mass distribution of a 
deflector can reproduce flux ratio and astrometric anomalies typically associated with 
the presence of a dark matter subhalo. Using Hubble Space Telescope images of nearby 
galaxies, we simulate strong lens systems with real distributions of stellar mass as they 
would be observed at redshift zd = 0.5. We add a dark matter halo and external shear to 
account for the smooth dark matter field, omitting dark substructure, and use a Monte Carlo 
procedure to characterize the distributions of image positions, time delays, and flux ratios
 for a compact background source of diameter 5 pc. By convolving high-resolution images of 
real galaxies with a Gaussian PSF, we simulate the most detailed smooth potential one could 
construct given high quality data, and find scatter in flux ratios of ~10%, which we 
interpret as a typical deviation from a smooth potential caused by large and small scale 
structure in the lensing galaxy. We demonstrate that the flux ratio anomalies arising from 
galaxy-scale baryonic structure can be minimized by selecting the most massive and round 
deflectors, and by simultaneously modeling flux ratio and astrometric data.

SHARP - IV. An apparent flux ratio anomaly resolved by the edge-on disc in B0712+472
Hsueh, J.-W. et al.
Flux ratio anomalies in quasar lenses can be attributed to dark matter substructure 
surrounding the lensing galaxy and, thus, used to constrain the substructure mass 
fraction. Previous applications of this approach infer a substructure abundance that 
potentially in tension with the predictions of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, the 
assumption that all flux ratio anomalies are due to substructure is a strong one, and 
alternative explanations have not been fully investigated.
...
The case of B0712+472 adds to the evidence that not all flux ratio anomalies are due to 
dark subhaloes, and highlights the importance of taking the effects of baryonic structures 
more fully into account in order to obtain an accurate measure of the substructure mass 
fraction.

Probing dark matter substructure in the gravitational lens HE0435-1223 with the WFC3 grism
Nierenberg, A. M. et al.

Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful test of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) as it enables the detection and mass measurement of low mass haloes even if they do not contain baryons. Compact lensed sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are particularly sensitive to perturbing subhalos, but their use as a test of CDM has been limited by the small number of systems which have significant radio emission. Radio emission is extended enough avoid significant lensing by stars in the plane of the lens galaxy, and red enough to be minimally affected by differential dust extinction. Narrow-line emission is a promising alternative as it is also extended and, unlike radio, detectable in virtually all optically selected AGN lenses. We present first results from a WFC3 grism narrow-line survey of lensed quasars, for the quadruply lensed AGN HE0435-1223. Using a forward modelling pipeline which enables us to robustly account for blending between nearby images and the main lens galaxy, we measure the [OIII] 5007 \AA$~$ flux ratios of the four lensed quasar images. We find that the lensed [OIII] fluxes and positions are well fit by a simple smooth mass model for the main lens. Our data rule out a $>10^{8} (10^{7.2}) M_{600}/M_\odot$ NFW perturber within $\sim$1."0 (0."1) arcseconds of the lensed images, where $M_{600}$ is the perturber mass within its central 600 pc. The non-detection is broadly consistent with the expectations of $\Lambda$CDM for a single system. The sensitivity achieved demonstrates that powerful limits on the nature of dark matter can be obtained with the analysis of the entire sample of narrow-line lenses.

Cold Dark Matter Substructures in Early-type Galaxy Halos
Authors:	
Fiacconi, et al

We present initial results from the ~Ponos~ zoom-in numerical simulations of dark matter substructures in massive ellipticals. Two very highly resolved dark matter halos with M vir = 1.2 × 1013 {M}~ and M vir = 6.5 × 1012 {M}~ and different (~violent~ versus ~quiescent~) assembly histories have been simulated down to z = 0 in a ~CDM cosmology with a total of 921,651,914 and 408,377,544 particles, respectively. 

....

We assess the impact of baryonic effects via twin, lower-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that include metallicity-dependent gas cooling, star formation, and a delayed-radiative-cooling scheme for supernova feedback. Baryonic contraction produces a super-isothermal total density profile and increases the number of massive subhalos in the inner regions of the main host. The host density profiles and projected subhalo mass fractions appear to be broadly consistent with observations of gravitational lenses.

We report the 4~ detection of a faint object with a flux of ~ 0.3 {mJy}, in the vicinity of the quadruply lensed QSO MG 0414+0534 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter array (ALMA) Band 7. The object is most probably a dusty dark dwarf galaxy, which has not been detected in either the optical, near-infrared, or radio (centimeter) bands. An anomaly in the flux ratio of the lensed images observed in Band 7 and the mid-infrared band and the reddening of the QSO light color can be simultaneously explained if we consider the object as a lensing substructure with an ellipticity of ~0.7 at a redshift of 0.5<= z<=1. Using the best-fit lens models with three lenses, we find that the dark matter plus baryon mass associated with the object is ~ {10}9 {M}%G~~%@ , the dust mass is ~ {10}7 {M}sun , and the linear size is ~> 5 kpc. Thus, our findings suggest that the object is a dusty dark dwarf galaxy. A substantial portion of faint submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the universe may be attributed to such dark objects.

Recently it has been claimed that the warm dark matter (WDM) model cannot at the same time reproduce the observed Lyman-~ forests in distant quasar spectra and solve the small-scale issues in the cold dark matter (CDM) model. As an alternative candidate, it was shown that the mixed dark matter (MDM) model that consists of WDM and CDM can satisfy the constraint from Lyman-~ forests and account for the "missing satellite problem" as well as the reported 3.5 keV anomalous x-ray line. We investigate observational constraints on the MDM model using strong gravitational lenses. We first develop a fitting formula for the nonlinear power spectra in the MDM model by performing N -body simulations and estimate the expected perturbations caused by line-of-sight structures in four quadruply lensed quasars that show anomaly in the flux ratios. Our analysis indicates that the MDM model is compatible with the observed anomaly if the mass fraction of the warm component is smaller than 0.47 at the 95% confidence level. The MDM explanation to the anomalous x-ray line and the small-scale issues is still viable even after this constraint is taken into account.
