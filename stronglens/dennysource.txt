	Why should substructure be destroyed in galactic halos but
not in clusters? Analytic calculations suggested that galaxies
should contain more satellites than are observed (Kauffmann,
White, & Guilderdoni 1993). The shape of the power spectrum
varies over these scales in a way such that galaxies form several
billions of years before the clusters, and as a result, the mass
function of their progenitor clumps may differ. Furthermore,
as the power spectrum asymptotically approaches a slope of
-3, clumps of all masses will be collapsing simultaneously,
and the timescale between collapse and subsequent merging
becomes shorter. - http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/312287/pdf
