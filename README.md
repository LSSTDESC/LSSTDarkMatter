# LSST Dark Matter

This is a repository to collect information related to the study of the fundamental nature of dark matter with LSST. Our goal is to uderstand the microphysics of dark matter: to identify the fundamental constituents of dark matter (e.g., new fundamental particles, compact objects, etc.), and to characterize the properties of these constituents (e.g, mass, temperature, self-interaction rate, etc.). LSST offers a unique avenue to attack the dark matter problem through "astrophysical probes"; however, there is also a significant overlap with experiments performing direct and indirect searches for dark matter.

# Resources

The LSST dark matter project began to take form at the [LSST DESC April 2017 Hack Week](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Hack+Week%3A+April+3-7+2017+-+FNAL). You can find more information on the results of that hack [on Confluence](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Hack+Week%3A+April+3-7+2017+-+Dark+Matter+Hack).

# How to Get Involved

The study of dark matter with LSST is a rapidly growing field. If you are interested in joining, there are several ways to get involved:
* Join our Slack channel: [#lsst-desc-darkmatter](https://lsstc.slack.com/messages/C4THJHURX)
* Join our email list: [<lsst-desc-darkmatter@slac.stanford.edu>](http://srs.slac.stanford.edu/GroupManager/exp/LSST-DESC/protected/mailLists.jsp)
* Check out our Confluence page: [wikipage](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Dark+Matter)
