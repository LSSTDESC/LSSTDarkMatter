# LSSTDarkMatter
A repo to go along with the [LSST DESC April 2017 Hack Week](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Hack+Week%3A+April+3-7+2017+-+FNAL) project on: [How can LSST/DESC contribute to understanding the fundamental nature of dark matter?](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Hack+Week%3A+April+3-7+2017+-+Dark+Matter+Hack).

## Goal for the Week
In the DESC science roadmap it says "The DESC is one aspect of this community effort, focused principally on the use of LSST to study observable signatures of â€œdark sector" physics, including dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos, and signatures of inflation." In this hack session we would like to explore the various ways that DESC could probe the fundamental nature of dark matter with LSST. The goal would be 1-2 days of brainstorming the science and feasibility, followed by a few days working towards fleshing out a "white paper/roadmap" that could be submitted for a "dark matter" working group.

## Deliverables for the Week
1. [github repo](../..) for DESC dark matter
2. brainstorm [table](table.md) of dark matter probes
3. literature reviews of various probes ([strong lensing](stronglens/substructure.md), [axions](axions/README.md), [clusters](clusters/readme.txt), ...)
4. feasibility notebooks for probes ([strong lensing](stronglens/SubstructureLikelihood.ipynb), [MACHOs](macho/LSST%20MACHO%20MAF%20Hack.ipynb))
