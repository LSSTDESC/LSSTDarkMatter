# LSST Dark Matter

This is a repository to collect information related to the study of the fundamental nature of dark matter with LSST. Our goal is to uderstand the microphysics of dark matter: to identify the fundamental constituents of dark matter (e.g., new fundamental particles, compact objects, etc.), and to characterize the properties of these constituents (e.g, mass, temperature, self-interaction rate, etc.). LSST offers a unique avenue to attack the dark matter problem through "astrophysical probes"; however, there is also a significant overlap with experiments performing direct and indirect searches for dark matter.

## Projects

There are many avenues to attack the dark matter problem with LSST. Below is a brief description of some that we have started to consider:

* Local Group Dwarf Galaxies ([satsim](satsim) and [satellites](satellites)): Local Group dwarf galaxies provide the most direct tracer of the low-mass end of the matter power spectrum and are sensitive to deviations from LCDM on the smallest scales.
* Stellar Streams ([streamsim](streamsim)]: Perturbations in stellar streams can be used to trace the dark matter subhalo population below the threshold for star formation.
* Strong Lensing Substructures ([stronglens](stronglens)): Dark matter substructure can be traced independently of baryons through perturbations in the strong lensing of galaxies at cosmological distances. 
* Axion Cooling of Stars ([axions](axions)): Axions (and other axion-like particles) would provide an alternative thermal transport mechanism altering stellar physics (e.g., white dwarf lifetimes)
* Galaxy Cluster Density Profiles ([clusters](clusters)):
* Microlensing ([macho](macho)): Searches for massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) using the microlensing of stars.

This is certainly not an exhaustive list, and we would be excited to add your new idea!

## Resources

* Dark Matter White Paper: We are in the process of writing a white paper to summarize the various avenues to attack the dark matter problem with LSST. 
* Living Bibliography: We have started to compile a living bibliography 
* Dark Matter Hack Session:  The LSST dark matter project began to take form at the [LSST DESC April 2017 Hack Week](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Hack+Week%3A+April+3-7+2017+-+FNAL). You can find more information on the results of that hack [on Confluence](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Hack+Week%3A+April+3-7+2017+-+Dark+Matter+Hack).
